# Exercises (course) 💪

## Getting started 🚀

First step: adapt the course name in the title to the correct one.

Congratulations! You now have your personal repository for exercises for this course.
If you use this structure, it'll make you more time-efficient and help your lecturer to aid you.

> ⚠️ If there's only one exercise per session, you can simply work directly in that folder.
> In case of multiple exercises during one sessions, it could be a good idea to create a subfolder for every exercise.
> When in doubt, ask your lecturer.

Start your first exercise in the folder for [session1](./session1).
